# File Management Platform

This project is a capstone for the back-end trimester, covering key concepts in authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The objective is to build a simplified platform for uploading and viewing files, simulating real-life services while reinforcing foundational back-end skills.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for users.
- **File Management**: 
  - List all uploaded files.
  - Upload new files.
  - Modify file permissions.
  - View individual files.
- **Image Processing**: Automatic thumbnail generation for uploaded images.
- **Background Processing**: Leveraging Redis to handle tasks in the background.

## Structure & Implementation

The project is modular, allowing flexibility in file organization. Core functions can be extended or reorganized, with the `utils` folder recommended for helper methods. Each feature is implemented in a step-by-step manner, with room for customization and refinement.

## Purpose

This platform is built for educational purposes, offering a hands-on experience in assembling essential back-end components into a functional product.

Enjoy learning and building!
